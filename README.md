✨Hey! Hi, my name is Santi, although I'm usually called Kohi.

🍀I have a knack for managing networks, or at least I like to think so. Currently, I am actively involved in MidesProjects, RagedValorant, and PlayMides.net. However, I have also worked on numerous other fascinating projects.

🌴In addition, I am currently honing my skills in Java programming. I specialize in organizing people, fostering the development of fresh ideas, and have been involved in a variety of other interesting projects.

🍁I hope this information proves helpful. If you wish to get in touch, you can find me @KohiLounges on Twitter!
